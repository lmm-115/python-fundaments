#tuples
#tuples are like lists but the tuple's values cannot be changed
t = (1,2,3)
mylist = [1,2,3]
print(type(t))
print(type(mylist))

#.count and .index method
t = ('a','a','b')
print(t.count('a')) #.count help us to count how many times an object is in a tuple
print(t.index('a')) #.index shows where is the first place that the object is called
print(t,mylist)
